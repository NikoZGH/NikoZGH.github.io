        <p class="paragraph1">Influenza is a “contagious respiratory illness” virus that infects the body through the nose, throat, and lungs causing the flu. The flu is NOT the same as the common cold.  Over the years, the influenza virus has evolved, making last year’s vaccines ineffective, which is why people need to get vaccinated every year.  Some examples include the A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 virus. Our main objective is to provide awareness about the flu vaccine and possibly provide them for FREE to the public, especially in low-income communities, which will be discussed in the solution page.
