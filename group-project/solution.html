             The solution that we came up with is a flu truck. The trucks will go around California providing flu shots to those who can’t get flu shots like low-income communities. The trucks will also be spreading information about the flu including where to get the flu vaccine, the symptoms of the flu, and when the season starts and ends. We are also spreading awareness of the flu through advertisements and this website which will hopefully educate the people about the flu and get vaccinated. One problem we thought of at first is the way that we are going to fund this. We’ll just make the CDC fund this because it is their responsibility to control the introduction and spread of diseases and the flu happens to be a disease. </span>
