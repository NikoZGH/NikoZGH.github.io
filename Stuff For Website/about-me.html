        <h2>Play Guitar/Ukulele</h2>
        
    
        <p>I played the ukulele before I played the guitar. The reason why I wanted to play was because of a show called Steven Universe. I liked the songs they had in it and I liked the sound of it. Then I got into guitar. First it was acoustic because of this youtuber named Emezie Okorafor. He's an animator and he makes his own music. So I got an acoustic guitar so I can learn how to play some of his songs. Turned out it was pretty hard :\. But im sure with the small amount of "skill" I have now I might be able to play some of them. Then I got into electric guitar. At the end of 7th grade I started listening to My Chemical Romance (MCR) alot. I began to like the sound of the guitar (played by Frank Iero) and how it ties the band together and makes the songs sound amazing. So I got a Stratocaster and I tried to learn their songs, I got down the chorus' but I need to actually put time into learning the songs. Now I also own a Telecaster and I like it because of its versatility in different genres of music. Im absolute garbage but maybe it'll actually get better.</p>
